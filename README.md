On 01.11.2023, Wednesday, I had a lab at Makmal Inovasi (322-02). I had gained hands-on experience on how to assemble and disassemble CPU hardware components at there.
In addition, I also gained insights into CPU hardware components that were previously unfamiliar to me such as the power supply, cooling fan, RAM , hard disk and internal cables.

Here are the simple ways in assembling the CPU
  1. Install power supply.
  2. Install cooling fan.
  3. Install RAM. 
  4. Install hard disk.
  5. Connect all cables to relevant part.
  6. Close the CPU cover and screw it using screw driver.

I had learn about the architecture of a computer system, including the role of the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and how data flows between these components.

There are certain things that I need to improve myself. Firstly, I need to review to the online resource before the lab so that I can familiarize myself with the tasks I will be undertaking.
Secondly, I should communicate with my group members and discuss with them before the lab so that everyone can had a more understanding about the lab that will be undertaking later.
Lastly, I should voice out my question to lecturer when I was not understanding so that I will not do a mistake.
