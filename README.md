On 01.11.2023, Wednesday, I had a lab at Makmal Inovasi (322-02). I had gained hands-on experience on how to assemble and disassemble CPU hardware components at there.
In addition, I also gained insights into CPU hardware components that were previously unfamiliar to me such as the power supply, cooling fan, RAM , hard disk and internal cables.

Here are the simple ways in assembling the CPU
  1. Install power supply.
  2. Install cooling fan.
  3. Install RAM. 
  4. Install hard disk.
  5. Connect all cables to relevant part.
  6. Close the CPU cover and screw it using screw driver.

I had learn about the architecture of a computer system, including the role of the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and how data flows between these components.
